# Smlst

The smallest valid HTML5 document.

## Why... just why!?

Because it’s fun!

Here it is:

```html
<!doctype html><title>·</title>
```

_Psst, you may want to download the [HTML file](src/smlst.html)_.

### Hum, is there any use-case for this?

Yup. You can use it to:

+ Create a really quick prototype.
+ Validate a chunk of HTML though the [W3C Validator]
  (http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
+ Make your coworkers think you’re cool.
